This code is for the SparkFun RedBoard Arduino with the ATmega328P
microcontroller and the Optiboot bootloader. I'm not sure which parts of that
information are relevant. I've included a pre-compiled binary in the repository.
To upload it, you need to install avrdude from apt. To compile and view the
binary, you'll need some other stuff. Here is how to get the dependencies from
apt, I think:

sudo apt install gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc avrdude

This is mostly just an experiment, but I have tried to implement a good chunk of
the ITU morse code standard. I have all the printable characters specified, plus
(starting signal) and (end of work) characters. I decided not to bother trying
to map every control character from morse code to ASCII.
